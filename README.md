# Network Intrusion Detection System Project

# Overview
 *This project aims to develop a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that can identify malicious activities or anomalies within a network. Due to the growing use of computer networks and the increasing number of applications running on them, network security has 
  become crucial. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a vital role in detecting threats and safeguarding network security.

# Objective
 * Our main goal is to analyze network traffic to detect anomalies and classify them into different types of attacks or normal activities. This involves two main tasks:

 * Binomial Classification: Determine if network activity is normal or an attack.
 * Multinomial Classification: Classify the type of activity (e.g., Normal, Back, Buffer Overflow, FTP Write, etc.).

# Data Description
 * The dataset comprises network traffic records collected over time, detailing various types of attacks and normal activities. Each record in the dataset contains information about network connection vectors, such as duration, protocol type, service, and many others, 
   leading to a detailed analysis basis.

# Features Include:
 * Basic features like duration, protocol type, service, flag status, and bytes transferred.
 * Content-related features like hot indicators, failed login attempts, and login status.
 * Traffic features based on time and host, including the number of connections, service rates, and error rates.
